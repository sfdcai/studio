# Automated Media Management System

This project provides a complete, automated pipeline for managing a large personal media library. It combines a powerful set of backend shell scripts with a modern Next.js web interface for monitoring and configuration.

The system uses a Linux server to automatically download photos and videos from an iCloud Photos account, deduplicates them against a central database, archives the originals to a local NAS, and uploads processed versions to a separate, reliable cloud archive (Google Drive).

## Features âœ¨

*   **Web UI Dashboard:** A modern Next.js interface to view the status of all files, see logs, and monitor processing in real-time.
*   **Centralized Configuration:** Manage all backend script settings directly from the web UI.
*   **Server-Side Sync:** Backend scripts automatically pull all media directly from iCloud Photos.
*   **Database-Driven:** Uses an SQLite database as the single source of truth, tracking every file, its metadata, and processing status.
*   **Bulletproof Deduplication:** Calculates a unique hash for each file to prevent duplicates from ever entering your archive.
*   **Robust Automation:** Leverages `systemd` timers for reliable, scheduled execution of the entire download-and-process workflow.
*   **Reliable Cloud Archive:** Uploads processed media to Google Drive using `rclone`.

## Installation and Setup

The setup is divided into two parts: setting up the backend processing engine and deploying the frontend web UI.

### **Part 1: Backend Setup (Media Processing)**

These steps configure the server to automatically download and process your media files.

#### 1. Prerequisites

*   A Linux server (physical or virtual). This guide is tailored for **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS**.
*   A NAS or storage location accessible from the server.
*   `git` installed on the server to clone this repository.
*   Python 3 and `pip` (for the `icloudpd` backend script).

#### 2. Run the Backend Environment Setup Script
Execute the `setup_media_server.sh` script. This script installs all required software for media processing (`rclone`, `ffmpeg`, `icloudpd`, etc.) and initializes the database.
```bash
# Clone the repository first if you haven't already
# git clone <your-repository-url>
# cd your-repository-folder

chmod +x setup_media_server.sh
sudo ./setup_media_server.sh
```

#### 3. Initial iCloud Authentication (CRITICAL STEP)
Before the automated scripts can work, you must log in to iCloud interactively **once** to create a session cookie. You will need to know your iCloud staging directory path, which you will configure in the Web UI in Part 2.
```bash
# Run this command and follow the prompts for your password and 2FA code.
# Use the staging directory path you plan to set in the UI (e.g., /data/nas/staging)
icloudpd --directory /path/to/your/staging_dir --username your_apple_id@email.com
```
Once it starts downloading, you can press `Ctrl+C`. The authentication session is now saved, and the automated scripts will be able to run non-interactively.

**Note:** This session may expire after a few weeks or months. You will need to run this command again when the automated script fails due to authentication errors.

#### 4. Configure Rclone
Run `rclone config` to set up your Google Drive remote (or any other cloud provider). Give it a name (e.g., `gdrive`). You will enter this name in the Web UI settings.

### **Part 2: Frontend Setup & Configuration (Web UI)**

This section describes how to deploy the Next.js web application and configure the entire system.

#### 1. Configure and Run the Deployment Script
The `deploy_ui.sh` script automates the installation of Node.js, dependencies, and configures the `pm2` process manager to run the app in a production environment.

Before running the script, you must edit it to point to your repository.
```bash
nano deploy_ui.sh
```
Find the `REPO_URL` variable and change it to your repository's SSH URL.
```sh
# Before
REPO_URL="git@github.com:your_username/your_repo.git"

# After (example)
REPO_URL="git@github.com:your-name/automated-media-server.git"
```

Now, execute the script. It will handle system updates, Node.js installation, cloning the repo, building the app, and running it with `pm2`.
```bash
chmod +x deploy_ui.sh
sudo ./deploy_ui.sh
```
The script will prompt you once to add the server's SSH key to your GitHub repository as a "Deploy Key". Follow the on-screen instructions.

#### 2. Configure the System via the Web UI
Once the script is finished, the application will be running.
*   **Access the UI:** Open your browser to `http://<your_server_ip>:3000`.
*   **Navigate to Settings:** Go to the "Settings" page in the application.
*   **Fill Out All Fields:** Carefully fill out all the settings, especially the "Backend Paths" and "Sync Services" sections. The paths you enter here **must** match the directories available on your server.
*   **Save Settings:** Click "Save Storage Settings". This will create the `config.conf` file in your project directory that the backend scripts need to run.

#### 3. Automate Backend Jobs with `systemd`
Now that the `config.conf` has been generated by the UI, you can enable the automated backend scripts.

```bash
# Copy systemd service/timer files from your project directory
sudo cp systemd/media_processor.* /etc/systemd/system/

# Enable and start the timer
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable media_processor.timer
sudo systemctl start media_processor.timer
```

### **Part 3: Updating the Application**
When you make changes to the application code and push them to your GitHub repository, you need to update the running application on your server.

> **Important Note:** Your server runs a local copy of the code. Pushing changes to GitHub does **not** automatically update the live application. You must run the restart command below to see your changes.

1.  **Push your code changes** to your main branch on GitHub.
2.  **Connect to your server** via SSH.
3.  **Navigate to the script location** (your repository folder).
4.  **Run the restart command:**
    ```bash
    sudo ./deploy_ui.sh --restart
    ```
This command safely pulls the latest code from GitHub, reinstalls any new dependencies, rebuilds the Next.js application, and gracefully restarts it using `pm2`.

## Usage Workflow ðŸš€

1.  **Let it Run:** The `systemd` timer will automatically trigger the backend scripts on its schedule to download and process new media.
2.  **Monitor the Dashboard:** Open the web UI in your browser (`http://<your_server_ip>:3000`) to see new files appear and their statuses change from `pending` to `success`. Check the **Logs** page for a live-aggregated view of the processing logs from the database.
