# =================================================
#
# Instructions:
# 1. Rename this file to 'config.conf'
# 2. Fill in the values below to match your environment.
#

# --- Apple iCloud Credentials ---
# Your Apple ID (email address). This is used by icloudpd.
APPLE_ID="your_apple_id@email.com"

# --- Directory Paths ---
# IMPORTANT: Use absolute paths to avoid issues when running from systemd.
#
# Directory where new media is downloaded from iCloud before processing.
STAGING_DIR="/data/nas/staging"
#
# Directory where original, unprocessed files are moved after successful processing.
ARCHIVE_DIR="/data/nas/archive"
#
# A temporary directory for compressed files before they are uploaded.
# This directory will be cleaned out after successful uploads.
PROCESSED_DIR="/data/processed/to_upload"
#
# Directory to store log files from the processing scripts.
LOG_DIR="/data/nas/logs"
#
# Absolute path to the SQLite database file. This MUST match the path
# the Next.js application uses. If you use the deploy_ui.sh script, this
# path should be correct.
DB_PATH="/root/mediaflow/media_library.sqlite"

# --- Rclone Configuration ---
# The name of your rclone remote for the cloud archive (e.g., 'gdrive').
RCLONE_REMOTE="gdrive"
#
# The destination path within the rclone remote (e.g., 'My Media Archive').
RCLONE_DEST_PATH="MediaFlowArchive"

# --- Processing Limits ---
# Set the maximum number of files to process in a single run. This prevents
# the script from running for too long if there's a large backlog.
PROCESS_LIMIT="1000"
